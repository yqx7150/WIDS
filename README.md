# Abstract
Scattering media causes the random refraction of light along their propagation
paths, which notably diminishes the clarity of optical imaging. Current
techniques predominantly focus on simple targets, thereby limiting their
practical applicability in complex scenarios. This work proposes an approach
for wavelet-refinement-inspired diffusion model for scattering imaging. A fullfrequency
component diffusion model is utilized to extract priori information
of global distribution, while a high-frequency component diffusion model is
utilized to acquire priori information about the details of the target. In the
reconstruction process, the trained models provide multi-scale constraints in
iterations of reconstruction, with the physics-based deconvolution providing
fidelity. The results indicate that this work outperforms traditional methods in
the reconstruction of complex targets while exhibits robust generalization
capabilities. Simulation and experimental validation show that the proposed
method can effectively remove the gridding artifacts in the reconstructed
images for complex targets. The average PSNR and SSIM of the reconstructed
image can reach 22.49 dB and 0.78, respectively. The highest resolution of the
algorithm can reach 28.51 lp/mm.
